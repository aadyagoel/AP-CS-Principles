Designed a game based on climate change for the final project that showcased how much each greenhouse gas (co2, ozone, methane) contributed to temperature rise*, gradually changing the color of the screen to a warmer color as the user "caught" more greenhouse gas particles, (the game was to avoid), and the temperature increased. 

*not according to the actual equations but just according to what contributed more and what contributed less. 

An extension I want to do is implement the temperature rise according to the actual equations. 

**How to play:**

The game is to avoid all the greenhouse gas particles up to a certain time limit (50 seconds) where if temperatures don't rise by 1.5 degrees, you win. If you don't avoid enough particles, and temperatures rise by at least 1.5 degrees in 50 seconds you lose.
