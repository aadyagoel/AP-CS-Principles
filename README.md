hellooo, github pages can look intimidating but don't hit the panic button! It's actually pretty easy, if uh you actually want to run my faulty code (see last line). The code should be above this Read Me file and to preview any of the code files you can click on them, and download if you'd like to run. 

Final Project: climateChange2; is a game in which the player has to avoid the greenhouse gases (methane, co2, ozone), (in order of deadly), for 60 seconds to prevent a max global temperature rise of 1.5 degrees celcius; the gases are in the form of particles and the amount they contribute to temperature rise is proportional (though only in terms of which is more deadly), to real life. As the temperature rises, the background of the screen gradually goes from light blue to orange. Although hard, it is possible to win. 

The goal of this project was to more intuitvely represent how much small units of CO2, methane, and ozone each contribute to global temperature rise. 

However, the actual math required for this in this was a bit hard to code in processing so it wasn't incorporated. An extension of the project would be to code these equations in a more math friendly language so we can _really_ simulate and get a feel for how much a certain number of co2 contributes to global temperature rise, and then add what produces this much co2 (driving 1 km in an average car etc). 

In order to play the game, one can use the keys 'b' and 'c' to move the earth (which is the player) right or left to avoid the methane (grey), c02 (red), and ozone (blue) particles that will fall from the sky.  

In order to run the code in the repository (folder with all the code files): one has to download the climateChange2 code, and an image: earth_PNG21 (this will also be in the repository) and save it in the same folder as the processing climateChange2 application file. (folder also has to be named climateChange2). Also sometimes the game doesn't run and the earth doesn't move (you have to run it again and again and eventually it works). 

Thank you for reading!ðŸ˜Š
