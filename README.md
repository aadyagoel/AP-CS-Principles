Final Project: climateChange2; was a game in which the player has to avoid the greenhouse gases (methane, co2, ozone), (in order of deadly), for 60 seconds to prevent a max global temperature rise of 1.5 degrees celcius; the gases are in the form of particles and the amount they contribute to temperature rise is proportional (though only in terms of which is more deadly), to real life. As the temperature rises, the background of the screen gradually goes from light blue to orange. Although rare, it is possible to win :)

The goal of this project was to more intuitvely represent how much a small unit of CO2 contributes to global temperature rise; all of us know it does but its hard to match exactly how much a unit of co2 contributes to global temperature rise.

However, the math in this was a bit hard to code in processing so it wasn't incorporated. An extension of the project would be to code these equations in a more math friendly language so we can _really_ simulate and get a feel for how much a drive to the park contributes to global temperature rise. 

In order to run the code in the repository: climateChange2, one has to download the image: earth_PNG21 and save it in the same folder as the processing climateChange2 application file. (folder has to also be named climateChange2).
