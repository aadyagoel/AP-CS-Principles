# AP-CS-Principles
Designed a game based on climate change for the final project that showcased how much each greenhouse gas (co2, ozone, methane) contributed to temperature rise*, gradually changing the color of the screen to a warmer color as the user "caught" more greenhouse gas particles, (the game was to avoid), and the temperature increased. 

*not according to the actual equations but just according to what contributed more and what contributed less. 

An extension I want to do is implement the temperature rise according to the actual equations, perhaps in a more math friendly language.
